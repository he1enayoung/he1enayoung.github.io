            <p>This in-process project represents one of my contributions to the Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW) Northwestern Chapter. One of our ongoing initiatives 
                is the AutoAquaponic system, which aims to design and maintain a fully automated aquaponic setup in our club office. This innovative system is intended to cultivate 
                both fish and plants autonomously for a duration of one month, with capabilities for remote monitoring and control. Our goal is to demonstrate a sustainable model that 
                enhances agricultural efficiency while minimizing environmental impact, positioning our project as a case study for successful implementation. Given that our system is 
                located in the basement—where natural sunlight is unavailable—we are tasked with creating an effective lighting solution to support plant growth. As part of this effort, 
                I am leading the Growlight project, which focuses on developing an automatically adjustable lighting system. This system will utilize sensors to adapt the light output 
                based on plant height, ensuring optimal growth conditions for taller plants.

            <p>The Growlight design incorporates two linear actuators that allow for precise vertical adjustments of the lighting structure. This enables the lights to be raised or lowered 
                according to the specific growth stage of the plants, ensuring optimal light exposure for photosynthesis. To support the lighting fixtures, a lightweight polycarbonate pocketed 
                panel is utilized, providing both strength and ease of installation. This reduces the overall weight of the system and enhances its durability. 
                Additionally, sensors are strategically mounted to the actuators to monitor plant height and health, providing real-time feedback to adjust the lighting conditions as needed.
