            <p> Individuals with hemiplegia are stroke survivors who experience paralysis on one side of their body, typically resulting in limited use of one 
                arm and one leg. One common challenge they face is the difficulty of putting on their own socks. To address this issue, I collaborated with a team 
                of three engineering students, alongside Dr. Kate Enzler and the Alexian Brothers Rehabilitation Hospital, to develop an innovative solution that would 
                assist individuals with hemiplegia in donning their socks independently. Our design prioritized durability and lightweight construction to ensure it 
                could withstand regular use while remaining easy to handle. We aimed for a user-friendly interface that would empower individuals with hemiplegia to 
                use the device independently, fostering greater autonomy and enhancing their daily living skills.

            <p> The main body of the SockAid is constructed from 4-inch inner diameter PVC pipe, featuring a 2-inch by 6-inch cutout in the center to accommodate rollers. 
                A taper and notch on one end of the main body enable users to easily slide the sock onto the device with one hand. The rollers, designed as 3D-printed cylinders 
                measuring 0.8 inches in diameter and 1.9 inches long, facilitate effortless entry for the user's foot, preventing it from getting stuck during use. Additionally, 
                the polypropylene straps are equipped with five loops for adjustable length, ensuring a secure fit for various users. A rigid handle maintains the straps wide and 
                positioned away from the leg, effectively preventing tangling and enhancing overall usability.
