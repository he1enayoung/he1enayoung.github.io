            <p>The Soft Stewart Platform robot was conceived as a way to explore the complexities of soft robot control. By developing a soft variant of the traditional rigid 
                Stewart platform, we aimed to gain deeper insights into the unique challenges and opportunities associated with controlling soft robots. This approach allowed 
                us to compare the control strategies used in soft robotics with those traditionally employed for rigid systems, helping to identify ways to optimize performance 
                and stability for soft robot systems. The initial phase of this project involved designing and building a soft Stewart platform, as detailed below. The concept was
                to use Handed Shearing Auxetics (HSAs), or soft 3D printed compliant structures that can be used to move a robot by converting a motor's rotation into extension and force
                to replace the rigid linear actuators on a traditional stewart platform.

            <p>I designed a SolidWorks CAD model of the system (seen above), simplifying the complexity of the HSAs by modeling them as linear actuators. This approach allowed me to focus on the 
                essential geometric relationships and ensure that the system was properly overconstrained, a critical aspect for achieving precise control and stability in the platform's 
                movement. By approximating the HSAs as linear components, I was able to streamline the early design phases while maintaining the necessary mechanical accuracy for subsequent 
                prototyping and testing.

            <p>The final design of the system features six HSAs that extend and contract to move the platform. Six Dynamixel motors power the actuators, 
                and wiring is housed within the base, and encased by laser cut acrylic and 3d printed side panelling. Additionally, strategically placed 
                3D-printed mounts are integrated throughout the design to support AprilTag positioning, allowing for accurate tracking and localization of the platform during operation.

            <p>Above is my poster presented at the Northwestern Undergraduate Research Exposition midway through this project, in May of 2024. Out of the 150 presenters, my poster and
                presentation won the top award for 'Best Research Presentation'.
