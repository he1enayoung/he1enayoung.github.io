            <p>The objective of this project, executed as a member of FIRST Robotics Competition Team 1678, was to design a pair of robotic arms that could lift the rest of the robot (approximately 120 lbs) up a set of 3 inclined bars. 
                Constraints included occupying as little space on the rest of the robot as possible while maintaining the range of motion needed to successfully get the robot 
                up the bars as quickly as possible, and mounting onto a drivetrain via a cross-tube through the middle. This needed to be implemented with the use of only 2 Falcon 500 motors.
