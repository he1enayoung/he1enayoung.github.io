            <p>The basis of this project was the control of the Soft Stewart Platform (design of which is described in the previous project
                description). This involved integration of the  vision system and camera through ROS, and using image data gathered to create a
                cascading PID controller for shape tracing, and a LSTM neural network for mapping motor position to ball position 
                over a time horizon.

            <p>This rviz screenshots illustrates the mapping of apriltag detections to a center projection for the top of the platform. 
                Vector manipulation allows this center projection to be compared to a fixed center_bottom projection in order to measure relative tilt and position
                of the platform in space. You can also see a mapping of the ball into the platform coordinate frame, where its coordinates are 
                represented relative to its center (at (0,0)).

            <p> I developed a cascading PID controller to autonomously control the ball's position, enabling the generation of the images above. 
                These images depict the ball moving across the platform, tracing predefined setpoints to form letters or words, such as a Northwestern 'N' 
                or 'Hello World.' The controller consists of two nested feedback loops: one for velocity control and the other for position control. By 
                mapping the motion of the rigid Stewart platform, the system calculates the necessary motor movements to align the ball's position and velocity 
                with the target values.

            <p> In addition to the PID controller, I used the PyTorch library to design and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network capable of 
                predicting the ball's future position by mapping motor twist angles and current ball positions over a defined time horizon. The training process 
                involved gathering control data by operating the platform manually over an extended period, during which I recorded measurements of both motor 
                and ball positions. This rich dataset allowed the LSTM to learn complex temporal dependencies between the platform's motor inputs and the ball's movements.
                The above images demonstrate the LSTM's ability to predict the y-coordinate of the ball's position. The top image illustrates a one-step-ahead prediction, 
                showcasing the network's immediate response accuracy, while the bottom image highlights a more challenging prediction over a five-step horizon, reflecting 
                the model's capacity to anticipate future states. Looking ahead, I intend to integrate this LSTM model into a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller. 
                This combination aims to enhance control accuracy and stability, with the potential to outperform the traditional PID controller in tasks requiring precise
                setpoint tracing.
